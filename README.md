# Week 2 README

## Common Mistakes

- no or improper head content (probably not started with `!` hot key)
- p tag with numbers like p2, p3 etc
- li with no list container like ul or ol
- only using h1 for all headings
- broken html tags

## Syntax to Review

- img tag
- the table tag
- the a tag (for links)
- em and strong tags
- ol and ul tags + li

## Recommendations
- start with a readme and plan out your goals
  - ie: to create a page that has x y and z on it
  - to experiment with a particular html syntax
  - to implement a ui element
- If you have uncertainties or confusion on topics or syntax, write those questions as well
  - ex: do I have to use a closing tag with `<img>`?
