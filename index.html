  <h1>Plan it then code it workflow</h1>
  <p>In week 2, we used the process of planning a webpage content out and then trying to organize it into html to
    practice our programming methodology.</p>

  <h2>Image Examples</h2>
  <p>images use the img tag and take a src="" for the location and alt="" for fallback text</p>

  <!-- Add an image from a url -->
  <h3>Image from a url</h3>
  <p>make sure to specify the EXACT image location</p>

    alt="shows up when user has a screen reader" height="600">

  <!-- Add an image from a file -->
  <h3>Image from a file</h3>
  <p>name the file with - instead of spaces and no capitals. store the file with your code.</p>

  <img src="gentoo-penguin.jpg" alt="shows up when the image doesn't load" width="400">

  <h2>Plan then Code Methodology</h2>
  <p>Steps to use when working though most coding projects</p>

  <h3>Project Setup</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify what your goal is (what do you want to make)</li>
    <li>Identify constraints and limitations (scope). where should you stop?</li>
    <li>Identify unknowns. topics that might be relevant but you aren't confident with</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Plan it out</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Use comments to map out the blocks of code</li>
    <li>If we need content, use AI / our creativity to make stuff up... or research depending the nature of the project
    </li>
    <li>Sketch out what the page should look like (very low fidelity)</li>
    <li>Look for inspiration</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Write your code!</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go top to bottom and write out the content with appropriate tags</li>
    <li>make commits regularly</li>
    <li>Check that the code is working</li>
    <li>If it's not working, read and think through why. critique your code ruthlessly</li>
    <li>After finishing one of tasks, step back and evaluate</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Using p2 or other numbered p tags</strong>: there is only 1 level of p tag</li>
    <li>using b or i tag for bold and italic</li>
    <li>This is wrong, no p2, use just p</li>
    <li>Don't use capitals in tag names</li>
    <li>Using li tag without wrapping it in an ol or ul</li>
    <li>not setting up the code with an ! hotkey (no metadata etc)</li>
    <li>naming the index.html file anything except for index.html</li>
    <li>Putting visible content outside of the body tags</li>
  </ul>
